    <h1> The Technology Excites Me </h1>
    <p> My greatest motivation in this field is simply because of how interesting the language of computers are.</p>
    <p> How the first computer was made, How coding has evolved. The efficiency and aesthetic of well-written code is an art to me. </p>
    <p> My introduction of computer technology was with old video games.</p>  
    <p> The graphics, mechanics, music, and variety of video games has grasped my attention as far back as I can remember.</p>
    <h2>"What is the goal?"</h2>
    <p> I will have designed atleast one game this semester. </p>
    <p> And reinvent the standard for video games in the near future. </p>
